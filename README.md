# One-Shot-Learning-with-Siamese-Networks-using-Keras-Face_identification-
Facial detection and recognition using Siamese model.
Function1 Save_face:Takes snapshot of the face and saves them
function2 Create_embeddings:Create embediings of the face using the siamese model
function3 :finds the face in front of the camera and compares with the embeddings of the saved face
THAT'S it



Thankyou :)
